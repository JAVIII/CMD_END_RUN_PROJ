# CMD_END_RUN_PROJ

This is what I have so far, I think the 60 frames a second is solved. It still looks jerky but that is
because the elements move in such large increments.  I have them independently adjustable from the 
framerate.  The obstacles are pretty solid though any comments are welcome. The enemies are in the 
game already but are buggy at best, and there is a rare but pretty substantial crash bug so enable them
at your own risk right now(they are commented out).  The game runs on linux by design, and will run 
on cygwin but will lock you out from typing after you cancel out of it at the moment. For the moment
it is just ctrl-c to end the game.
